    +'<p>Strona internetowa HEALINO Sp. z o.o. (zwana dalej Stroną) używa plik&oacute;w Cookie. Pliki Cookies to pliki wysyłane do przeglądarki za pośrednictwem serwera internetowego w celu rejestrowania działań Użytkownika w określonej sieci. Pierwszym celem plik&oacute;w Cookies jest zapewnienie użytkownikowi szybszego dostępu do wybranych usług. Ponadto Cookies personalizują usługi oferowane przez Internet, ułatwiając i oferując każdemu użytkownikowi informacje, kt&oacute;re mogą go zainteresować, w związku z korzystaniem z Usług.</p>'
    +'<p>Sieć wykorzystuje pliki Cookies w celu personalizacji i ułatwienia przeglądania. Pliki Cookies są kojarzone wyłącznie z anonimowym użytkownikiem i jego komputerem i nie zawierają odniesień, kt&oacute;re pozwalają na ujawnienie danych osobowych użytkownika. Użytkownik może skonfigurować swoją przeglądarkę, aby powiadamiała i odrzucała instalację Cookies wysłanych przez Internet nie ograniczając dla możliwości dostępu użytkownika do zawartości wspomnianej sieci. Jednakże trzeba mieć na uwadze, że w każdym przypadku wydajność Strony może się zmniejszyć.</p>'
    +'<p>Zarejestrowani użytkownicy, kt&oacute;rzy rejestrują się lub są zalogowani, mogą skorzystać z bardziej spersonalizowanych i zorientowanych na profil usług, łącząc dane przechowywane w plikach Cookies z danymi osobowymi wykorzystanymi w momencie rejestracji. Użytkownicy ci wyraźnie zezwalają na wykorzystanie tych informacji do wskazanego celu, bez naruszenia ich prawa do odmowy lub wyłączenia korzystania z plik&oacute;w Cookies.</p>'
    +'<p>Sieć internetowa będzie także w stanie poznać wszystkie usługi wymagane przez użytkownik&oacute;w, aby ułatwić lub oferować informacje odpowiednie dla gust&oacute;w i preferencji każdego użytkownika.</p>'
    +'<p>Typ, cel i działanie Cookies</p>'
    +'<p>Pliki Cookies, w zależności od ich trwałości, można podzielić na "Cookies sesyjne" lub "Cookies trwałe". Pierwsze wygasają, gdy użytkownik zamknie przeglądarkę. Te drugie wygasają w zależności od tego, kiedy cel, dla kt&oacute;rego służą, jest spełniony (na przykład, aby użytkownik pozostał zidentyfikowany w Usługach) lub gdy zostaną one ręcznie usunięte.</p>'
    +'<p>Dodatkowo, w zależności od celu, pliki Cookies można sklasyfikować w następujący spos&oacute;b:</p>'
    +'<ul>'
    +'<li> Pliki Cookies dotyczące wydajności: ten rodzaj plik&oacute;w Cookies zapamiętuje Twoje preferencje dotyczące narzędzi znalezionych w usługach, dzięki czemu nie musisz ponownie konfigurować usługi za każdym razem, gdy odwiedzasz witrynę. Dla przykładu ten rodzaj obejmuje:</li>'
    +'</ul>'
    +'<p>- Regulację głośności odtwarzaczy wideo lub dźwięku.</p>'
    +'<p>- Prędkość transmisji wideo zgodną z Twoją przeglądarką.</p>'
    +'<ul>'
    +'<li> Pliki Cookies dla geolokalizacji: Te pliki Cookies są wykorzystywane do ustalenia kraju, w kt&oacute;rym się znajdujesz, gdy korzystasz z usługi. Te pliki Cookies są całkowicie anonimowe i służą jedynie do kierowania treści na potrzeby lokalizacji.</li>'
    +'<li> Pliki Cookies związane z rejestracją: Pliki te są generowane po zarejestrowaniu się użytkownika lub p&oacute;źniej podczas otwarcia nowej sesji i służą do identyfikacji go w usługach z następującymi celami:</li>'
    +'</ul>'
    +'<p>- Zachowanie danych użytkownika w taki spos&oacute;b, aby po zamknięciu usługi, przeglądarki lub komputera i w innym czasie lub innym dniu ponownie włączył tę usługę, pozostanie zidentyfikowany, ułatwiając nawigację bez konieczności ponownej identyfikacji. Funkcję tę można wyłączyć, jeśli użytkownik kliknie funkcję "zamknij sesję", w&oacute;wczas ten plik cookie zostanie usunięty, a przy następnym wejściu użytkownika do usługi użytkownik będzie musiał się zalogować, aby ponownie go zidentyfikować.</p>'
    +'<p>- Sprawdzenie, czy użytkownik ma uprawnienia dostępu do niekt&oacute;rych usług, na przykład do wzięcia udziału w konkursie.</p>'
    +'<ul>'
    +'<li> Pliki Cookies analityczne: za każdym razem, gdy użytkownik odwiedza Stronę, narzędzia od zewnętrznych dostawc&oacute;w (Google Analytics, Comscore i podobne, kt&oacute;re można dodać do tej listy w przypadku, gdy r&oacute;żnią się one od bieżących), generuje analityczne plik Cookie na komputer użytkownika. Ten plik Cookie, kt&oacute;ry jest generowany tylko podczas wizyty, będzie służyć podczas następnych wizyt w Usługach dostępnych na Stronie, aby anonimowo zidentyfikować odwiedzającego. Gł&oacute;wne cele to:</li>'
    +'</ul>'
    +'<p>- Zezwalanie na anonimową identyfikację użytkownik&oacute;w przeglądających Stronę za pośrednictwem "Cookies" (identyfikuje przeglądarki i urządzenia, a nie osoby), a tym samym wskazuje przybliżoną ewidencję liczby odwiedzających i ich trend w czasie.</p>'
    +'<p>- Anonimowa identyfikacja najczęściej odwiedzanych treści, a przez to bardziej atrakcyjnych dla użytkownik&oacute;w.</p>'
    +'<p>- Sprawdzenie, czy użytkownik, kt&oacute;ry uzyskuje dostęp, jest nowy, czy odwiedza Stronę po raz kolejny.</p>'
    +'<p>Ważne: jeśli użytkownik nie zdecyduje się zarejestrować w na Stronie, "plik Cookie" nigdy nie zostanie powiązany z żadnymi danymi osobowymi, kt&oacute;re mogą go zidentyfikować. Takie pliki Cookies będą wykorzystywane wyłącznie do cel&oacute;w statystycznych, aby w ten spos&oacute;b zoptymalizować komfort korzystania ze Strony.</p>'

    +'    <li> Pliki Cookies reklamowe: Ten rodzaj plik&oacute;w "Cookies" pozwala rozszerzyć informacje o wyświetlanych reklamach każdemu anonimowemu użytkownikowi w usługach oferowanych przez Stronę. Między innymi, czas trwania lub częstotliwość wyświetlania pozycji reklamowych, interakcji z nimi lub wzorc&oacute;w przeglądania i / lub zasob&oacute;w użytkownika są przechowywane, ponieważ pomagają w kształtowaniu profilu zainteresowania reklamą. W ten spos&oacute;b pozwalają oferować reklamy związane z zainteresowaniami użytkownika.</li>'
    +'<li> Pliki Cookies w odniesieniu do reklam dostawc&oacute;w zewnętrznych: Opr&oacute;cz reklam internetowych zarządzanych w ramach Usług dostępnych na Stronie, Internet oferuje swoim reklamodawcom opcję wyświetlania reklam za pośrednictwem stron trzecich ("AdServers"). W ten spos&oacute;b zewnętrzni dostawcy reklamy mogą przechowywać Cookies wysyłane z usług internetowych z przeglądarek Użytkownik&oacute;w, a także uzyskiwać dostęp do przechowywanych w nich danych.</li>'
